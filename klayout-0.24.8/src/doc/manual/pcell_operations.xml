  <p>
  PCell's can be created from shapes if the PCell is derived from a "guiding shape". 
  Specifically the Basic library PCell's support derivation from guiding shapes with a few
  exceptions. So for example, a round-cornered polygon can be created from a 
  normal polygon by selecting the polygons, choosing "Edit/Selection/Convert To PCell" and 
  selecting the "Basic.ROUND_POLYGON" for the PCell.
  </p>

  <p>
  PCell's can be converted to normal cells by choosing "Edit/Cell/Convert Cell To Static" 
  or "Edit/Layout/Convert All Cells To Static". Normal (static) cells can be edited
  individually but do no longer offer parameters to control the look of the cell.
