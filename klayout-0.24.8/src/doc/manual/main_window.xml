  <title>The Main Window</title>
  <keyword name="Main window"/>

  <p>
  The main window is divided into three parts: the left panel is the
  hierarchy browser which depicts the cell hierarchy. Cell nodes can be
  expanded showing the child nodes. The cell selected in the cell browser
  is shown in the center panel.
  </p>
  <p>
  The center panel is the actual canvas. There, the layout is drawn. Click
  there to zoom or to draw rulers for measuring distances.
  </p>
  <p>
  The right panel is showing the layer list with the layer drawing style.
  Below a set of control panels is located. The control panels are
  minimized per default. They can be expanded by clicking on the header
  bar. 
  </p>
  <p>
  Several control panels are available allowing to control colors, fill
  and drawing styles etc. Select one or many layers in the layer list to
  apply the selections from the control panels to.
  </p>
  <p>
  Multiple layouts can be shown at once. Either they can be overlayed or
  they can be shown in separate views. In this case, a tab panel appears
  at top of the main window. Switch between the views by selecting the
  tab.
