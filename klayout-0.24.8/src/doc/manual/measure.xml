  <title>Doing Measurements</title>
  <keyword name="Rulers"/>

  <p>
  A measurement can be performed by choosing "Ruler" mode in the toolbar and 
  left-clicking a point in the layout
  and left-clicking another point. A ruler will be shown that indicates
  the distance measured. 
  </p>
  <p>
  Various options can be specified for the rulers using the setup dialog.
  To show the setup dialog, choose "Setup" from the "File" menu.
  </p>
  <p>
  On the "Rulers" tab, different options can be selected. A ruler can be
  made to snap to edges of objects by selecting "Snap to edge/vertex".
  Ruler orientations can be constrained by using the "Angle Constraint"
  options. 
  </p>

  <p>
  While drawing or moving one point of a ruler, the direction constraint
  can be overridden with the Shift and Ctrl keys: pressing Shift while moving the
  mouse will enforce orthogonal constraint, Ctrl will enforce diagonal constraint 
  while pressing both will release any direction constraint.
  </p>

  <p>
  The number of rulers can be limited. If the number of rulers specified
  is two for example, only the last two rulers are shown. 
  </p>
  <p>
  All rulers can be cleared using the "Clear all rulers" function from the
  "Edit" menu.
  </p>
  <p>
  Ruler dragging can be canceled with the "Esc" key or using the "Cancel"
  function from the "Edit" menu.
  </p>
  <p>
  Rulers can be moved by selecting "Move" mode with the speedbar buttons
  in the toolbar or "Move" from the "Mode" submenu in the "Edit" menu. Then
  left-click and drag the ruler or the ruler end point that should be changed.
  </p>
  <p>
  Rulers can be deleted selectively by selecting a ruler in "Select" mode and
  pressing "Delete".
  </p>
  <p> 
  Rulers can be modified in a variety of ways. For example, rulers can be shown
  as arrows. To edit the properties of a ruler, double-click the ruler or 
  select it and use "Properties" from the "Edit" menu. 
  See <link href="/manual/ruler_properties.xml"/> for a description of the 
  properties.
  </p>
  <p> 
  Multiple templates can be configured to be available for rulers. If multiple
  templates are available, the "Ruler" mode toolbar button will show a drop-down
  menu which allows selecting of one template to be used. Templates can be edited in the 
  ruler setup page ("Setup" from the "File" menu) or "Ruler Setup" from the "Edit" menu.
